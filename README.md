I: Display the total quantity ordered of each product supplied by each vendor. List the output by vendor name (A to Z).

J: Find the largest line item on each invoice. Largest in this case means the largest total amount (quantity x price).Display the SKU number, the invoice number, and the amount. List the output in order by invoice number with the lowestinvoice number first. Note: It is possible to have more than one “largest” line item on an invoice. This could occur iftwo (or more) line items have the same total amount. For example, invoice 907 has items 7532-PY3 and 3754-MAK and both ofthese have a total amount of 65.97. Therefore they both will appear in the query results. It is also possible to havethe same item more than once on the same invoice. These duplicate items may (like invoice 415) or may not(like invoice 162) cause both items to appear in the results.
